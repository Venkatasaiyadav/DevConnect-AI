## 🚀 Overview

DevConnect AI is a full-stack developer community platform that unifies fragmented developer workflows — discussions, Q&A, collaboration, and AI-powered drafting help — into a single ecosystem.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Developers today are scattered across:
- **Discord** for community chats
- **StackOverflow** for Q&A
- **Reddit** for discussions
- **GitHub** for collaboration

There's no single platform that combines all of this with built-in AI assistance. DevConnect AI solves that.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) |
| UI Library | React 19 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 / CSS variables |
| Authentication | Firebase Auth (Google + GitHub OAuth) |
| Database | Firestore (Firebase) |
| Icons | lucide-react |
| Markdown Rendering | react-markdown + remark-gfm |
| AI | Sarvam AI (Chat Completions API) |

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication
- Sign in / Sign up via **Google OAuth**
- Sign in / Sign up via **GitHub OAuth**
- User profile auto-saved to Firestore on first login
- Protected routes — unauthenticated users redirected to `/login`

### 🧑‍💻 Community
- Developer feed with posts (create, edit, delete)
- Real-time updates via Firestore `onSnapshot`
- Like / unlike posts
- Comment system — add, edit, and delete comments
- Markdown-rendered posts and code blocks (headings, lists, inline code, fenced code blocks)
- In-line code editor for inserting formatted code snippets into posts
- Trending discussions, Questions board, Collaborations, Saved Posts (UI scaffolded)

### 🤖 AI Features
- **Draft with AI Assistant**: describe what you're stuck on, and the AI rewrites it into a clear, well-structured discussion post — including problem description, what you've tried, and what kind of help you're looking for.
  - The assistant is intentionally scoped to **only help phrase the question** — it does not solve the problem or provide answers, keeping discussions genuinely open for the community to respond to.
  - Powered by the **Sarvam AI** chat completions API via a secure server-side Next.js API route (`/api/ai-draft`).
- Code Review Copilot (UI ready, backend in progress)

## ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before setting up:

- **Node.js** v18 or higher → [Download](https://nodejs.org)
- **npm** v9 or higher (comes with Node.js)
- A **Firebase** account → [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
- A **GitHub OAuth App** (for GitHub login) → [github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers)
- A **Sarvam AI** API key → [sarvam.ai](https://www.sarvam.ai) (for "Draft with AI Assistant")

Check your versions:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

## ⚙️ Local Setup

### 1. Fork the repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of this page to fork it to your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone your fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DevConnect-AI.git
cd DevConnect-AI
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all dependencies, including `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` used for rendering post content.

### 4. Set up Firebase (see section below)

### 5. Set up Sarvam AI (see section below)

### 6. Create your `.env.local` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Or create it manually and fill in your Firebase and Sarvam AI credentials (see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables)).

### 7. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

---

## 🔥 Firebase Setup

### Step 1 — Create a Firebase project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Click **Add project** → give it a name → click through setup
3. Once created, go to **Project Settings** (gear icon) → **Your Apps**
4. Click **Web (`</>`)** → register the app → copy the config object

### Step 2 — Enable Firestore

1. In the left sidebar, go to **Build → Firestore Database**
2. Click **Create database** → choose **Start in test mode** (for development)
3. Select a region → click **Done**

### Step 3 — Enable Authentication providers

1. Go to **Build → Authentication → Sign-in method**
2. Enable **Google** — click the toggle → save
3. Enable **GitHub**:
   - Go to [github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - Click **New OAuth App**
   - Set **Homepage URL** to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Set **Authorization callback URL** to the one shown in Firebase (e.g. `https://<your-project>.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler`)
   - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** back into Firebase → save

### Step 4 — Copy your Firebase config

From **Project Settings → Your Apps → SDK setup and configuration**, copy all the config values into your `.env.local`.

## 🤖 Sarvam AI Setup

The **Draft with AI Assistant** feature uses the [Sarvam AI](https://www.sarvam.ai) chat completions API.

1. Sign up at [sarvam.ai](https://www.sarvam.ai) and generate an API key from your dashboard.
2. Add the key to `.env.local` as `SARVAM_API_KEY` (see below).
3. The API key is used **server-side only**, via `app/api/ai-draft/route.js` — it is never exposed to the browser.
4. If you see a `model deprecated` error, check Sarvam's docs for the current supported model names (e.g. `sarvam-30b`, `sarvam-105b`) and update the `model` field in `route.js` accordingly.

> ⚠️ Never commit your Sarvam API key. If a key is ever accidentally committed or shared, rotate it immediately from the Sarvam dashboard.

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project with the following keys:

```env
# Firebase
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Sarvam AI (server-side only — do NOT prefix with NEXT_PUBLIC_)
SARVAM_API_KEY=your_sarvam_api_key
```

> ⚠️ Never commit `.env.local` to Git. It is already added to `.gitignore`.
>
> Restart your dev server (`npm run dev`) after adding or changing any environment variable — Next.js only loads `.env.local` on startup.

All Firebase values are available in **Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your Apps → SDK config**.
